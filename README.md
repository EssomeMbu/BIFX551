# BBIFX 551 - Spring 2020
## Dr. Chris Malec

### Course Description:

This class provides an introduction to programming for bioinformatics, with a focus on programming in R and tools to communicate and develop your code. Emphasis will be placed on good development practices and reproducible research. Significant time will be spent learning to program within an integrated development environment, cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing data.

-	Instructor: Chris Malec, PhD
-	Office Hours: In-person office hours will be held Wednesdays immediately after class. Appointments can be made for other times as needed.
-	Prerequisites: BIFX 501 or BIFX 502

### Learning Objectives
On completion of this course, students should be comfortable with the following:
-	Best practices for developing code
- Concepts of Reproducible Research
-	R programming and package development within RStudio
-	Version tracking using git
-	Collaborative software development using GitHub

### Grading:
- Homework (25%): Short reading assignments and exercises that reinforce what we discuss in class.
- In-class participation (25%): Engaging during class with the exercises and collaborating well with fellow students.
-	Course Projects (50%): There will be three larger projects that apply the individual concepts covered in class, homework, and readings.
    - Create a reproducible report from a biological dataset (20%) 
    - Write an  R package (15%)
    - Create an app with R shiny (15%).

- Attendance is not an explicit part of your grade, however your attendance is critical to your success.
        - If you must miss a class, getting notes from a classmate is your responsibility. 
        - More than three unexcused absences will drop your final grade by one letter grade. 

### Academic Integrity:

You are expected to abide by the honor code and include it on your assignments. All work you turn in should be your own, or the work of your group in the case of a group project.  If you have any questions about what is acceptable help, ask me.

### Accommodations for Disabilities: 

This course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect oneâ€™s equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome (and not required) to contact me by email, phone, or during office hours to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421 or AccessibilityServices@hood.edu). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.  


### Tentative Schedule
Reading assignments for each week should be read prior to class. Links are provided to online resources when available.
