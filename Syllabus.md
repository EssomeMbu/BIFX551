### Learning Objectives
On completion of this course, students should be comfortable with the following:
-	Best practices for developing code
- Concepts of Reproducible Research
-	R programming and package development within RStudio
-	Version tracking using git
-	Collaborative software development using GitHub

### Grading:
- Homework (25%): Short reading assignments and exercises that reinforce what we discuss in class.
- In-class participation (25%): Engaging during class with the exercises and collaborating well with fellow students.
-	Course Projects (50%): There will be three larger projects that apply the individual concepts covered in class, homework, and readings.
    - Create a reproducible report from a biological dataset (20%) 
    - Write an  R package (15%)
    - Create an app with R shiny (15%).

### Tentative Schedule
Reading assignments for each week should be read prior to class. Links are provided to online resources when available.
